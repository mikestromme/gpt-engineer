Based on the requirements, here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. User: Represents a user in the system. It will have attributes such as username, password, and role.

2. AuthenticationManager: Responsible for handling user authentication. It will have methods like login, logout, and verify_credentials.

3. AuthorizationManager: Handles user authorization. It will have methods like check_permission and get_user_role.

4. DatabaseManager: Handles database operations, including calling stored procedures. It will have methods like execute_stored_procedure and execute_query.

5. FlaskApp: The main Flask application class. It will handle routing, views, and rendering templates.

6. MenuDrawer: Represents the menu drawer on the left side of the website. It will have methods like expand, collapse, and render_menu.

7. CSSStyler: Handles the styling of the website using CSS. It will have methods like apply_styles and render_stylesheet.

Now, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their content.

1. `user.py`

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class User:
    username: str
    password: str
    role: str
```

2. `authentication_manager.py`

```python
class AuthenticationManager:
    def login(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
        # Authenticate the user with Active Directory
        # Return True if successful, False otherwise
        pass

    def logout(self) -> None:
        # Perform logout operations
        pass

    def verify_credentials(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
        # Verify the user's credentials with Active Directory
        # Return True if valid, False otherwise
        pass
```

3. `authorization_manager.py`

```python
class AuthorizationManager:
    def check_permission(self, user: User, permission: str) -> bool:
        # Check if the user has the required permission
        # Return True if authorized, False otherwise
        pass

    def get_user_role(self, user: User) -> str:
        # Get the role of the user
        # Return the role as a string
        pass
```

4. `database_manager.py`

```python
class DatabaseManager:
    def execute_stored_procedure(self, procedure_name: str, params: dict) -> None:
        # Execute the specified stored procedure with the given parameters
        pass

    def execute_query(self, query: str) -> list:
        # Execute the specified SQL query and return the results as a list
        pass
```

5. `flask_app.py`

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    # Render the home template
    return render_template('home.html')

# Define other routes and views

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

6. `menu_drawer.py`

```python
class MenuDrawer:
    def expand(self) -> None:
        # Expand the menu drawer
        pass

    def collapse(self) -> None:
        # Collapse the menu drawer
        pass

    def render_menu(self) -> str:
        # Render the menu drawer HTML
        pass
```

7. `css_styler.py`

```python
class CSSStyler:
    def apply_styles(self) -> None:
        # Apply the CSS styles to the website
        pass

    def render_stylesheet(self) -> str:
        # Render the CSS stylesheet
        pass
```

These are the core classes and functions required for the website. We will now proceed to create the necessary files and their content.
