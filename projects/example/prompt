Write code for a website using html, css and javascipt that contains a single button.  When the button is clicked, I want the background of the page to change colors and I want a random image from https://picsum.photos/500 to be displayed on a seperate line under the button.  The random image should also change with every click of the button.  Additionally, I'd like a random inspiration quote to be displayed highlighted in black with a yellow text color under the random picture.  Please center all content and make sure to keep the button above the image and the quote.
